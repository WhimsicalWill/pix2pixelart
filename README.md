A GAN project that turns images into pixelart

Turn videos and images to pixelart with the following commands

# Installation

run conda install requirements.yml

# Goals and Notes
The pixelart filter should work on images and also work seamlessly on video.

Will video have a good enough understanding of state?

There should be more features added as well
Use a depth map to create some part of the image a certain way (think matrix/code), and maybe control depth using music?

Maybe we could also have a custom sky?
